#Ocarina
This is a text based (Zorkish) version of The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time. By Nintendo. 

It's pretty easy to run and modify so take a look at the code.

#### Legal
This is probably illegal... Don't tell Nintendo.
I'm getting the script from [this guy](http://www.neoseeker.com/ocarinaoftime/faqs/162138-zelda-64-script.html) so blame it on him. (Sorry)
